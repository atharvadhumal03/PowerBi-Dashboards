## Saffron Emcommerce Sales Dashboard

Overview:
The following Power BI project consisted of creating an interactive analytical dashboard for a client company called Saffron Ecommerce. The dashboard was built using two data sets:
1) details.csv

The purpose of creating this interactive dashboard was to enable proficient tracking and analysis of sales data for Saffron Ecommerce. This folder contains the final result of the interactive analytical Power BI dashboard. The following project demonstrates my skill with the Power BI data visualization software and its different features, visualizations as well as my expertise with thorougly understanding data and creating an extensive analytical report/dashboard.
