## HR Analytics Dashboard 

Overview: 
The following Power BI project consisted of creating an interactive analytical dashboard for analyzing attrition in a client company. The dashboard was built using a single datasset:
1) HR_Analytics.csv

To begin the creating the dashboard it was essential to first clean the data. Before creating the report the data set was thoroughly cleaned which involved handling null values, removing duplicate records, standardizing data and more. The purpose of creating this interactive analytical dashboard is to allow effective understanding of the company's attrition rates and the various factors contributing to them. It aims to identify key elements behind the attrition data, providing valuable insights for better decision-making. This folder contains the final result of the interactive analytical Power BI dashboard. The following project demonstrates my skill with the Power BI data visualization software and its different features, visualizations as well as my expertise with thorougly understanding data and creating an extensive analytical report. 

Dashboard Overview: 
The dasboard displays the following essential sales data for analysis:
- Crucial KPIs:
1) Total employees
2) Attrition rate (percentage) 
3) Average salary at company 
4) Total attritions 
5) Average employee age 
6) Average years at company 
- Attrition by education

Additionally, the dashboard is equipped with a filter which helps the company fiter data by departments.
